In order to find out whether the text is in pig-latin or rot13 I could check if at least 5 (or some significant percentage of the total amount of) words ends with "ay" or has no vowels, respectively.

Though some words in normal English have end with "ay" or have no vowels it is definitely not a significant percentage of any given text and therefore using a while for a counter as the percentage of the total amount of words should indicate whether it is transformed or not.

The code for decoding rot13 is identical to encoding rot13.

The code for decoding pig-latin is done by deleting the "ay" and bringing the preceding letters to "ay" to the front. The problem with this is that pig-latin encoding is not injective.
